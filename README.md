Here's a sample `README.md` file for your Flask app, which includes steps for running the app, setting up the database, and executing migration commands.

# Flask App with MySQL Database and Migrations

This is a Flask application connected to a MySQL database, using Flask-Migrate for handling database migrations. The app also integrates with LocalStack for S3 emulation.

## Requirements

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Python 3.9+
- MySQL (Dockerized)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Build and Start the Services

This project uses Docker Compose to manage services such as MySQL, Flask, and LocalStack.

Run the following command to build and start all the services:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will:

- Start the `mysql` service with MySQL running on port `3306`.
- Start the `flask_app` service (Flask app connected to MySQL).
- Start the `localstack` service (AWS S3 mock).

### 3. Access the Application
After starting the services, your Flask app will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.

### 4. Database Setup and Migrations

#### Installing Dependencies
To set up migrations, you need `Flask-Migrate` and `Flask-SQLAlchemy`. If you haven't installed the dependencies yet, run:

```bash
pip install Flask-Migrate Flask-SQLAlchemy
```

#### Initialize Migrations
If this is the first time you're setting up migrations, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose run flask_app flask db init
```

This will create the `migrations/` directory in your project.

#### Create Migrations for Database Changes
Whenever you make changes to your database models, create a migration file:

```bash
docker-compose run flask_app flask db migrate -m "Describe the changes"
```

#### Apply Migrations
To apply the latest migrations and update the database schema:

```bash
docker-compose run flask_app flask db upgrade
```

#### Rollback Migrations (If Needed)
To revert the database to the previous version:

```bash
docker-compose run flask_app flask db downgrade
```

#### View Current Migration Version
To see the current migration version of your database:

```bash
docker-compose run flask_app flask db current
```

### 5. Dockerized Setup

- **MySQL**: The MySQL container runs with the database `ecommerce` and user `root` with password `root`. The MySQL service is available on port `3307` on your local machine.
- **Flask App**: The Flask application runs on port `5000` on your local machine.
- **LocalStack**: LocalStack provides an emulation of AWS services, and S3 is enabled on port `4566`.

### 6. Example Usage

- You can access the Flask app by navigating to `http://localhost:5000`.
- Interact with your Flask API and test database operations.

### 7. Stopping the Services

To stop the Docker containers, use the following command:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

This will stop and remove all containers, but the database data will be preserved in the Docker volume (`mysql_data`).
